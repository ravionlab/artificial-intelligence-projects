## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. This repository provides an extensive guide covering both the theoretical aspects and practical implementations of AI. Here, you'll find everything from introductory materials to deep dives into advanced AI techniques.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI systems are designed to learn, reason, and solve problems, often by mimicking cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving.
