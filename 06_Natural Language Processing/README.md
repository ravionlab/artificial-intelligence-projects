## Introduction üí°

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of study focused on the interaction between computers and human language. This repository offers an in-depth exploration of both the **theoretical foundations**‚Äîfrom probabilistic models to advanced deep learning architectures‚Äîand the **practical aspects** of building state-of-the-art NLP systems.

Whether you are a researcher seeking to understand the mathematical models behind language or a developer eager to implement cutting-edge applications, this guide aims to provide a clear and detailed roadmap.

## Theoretical Foundations üìñ

### Statistical & Probabilistic Models
- **Language Modeling:**  
  At its core, NLP began with statistical approaches such as *n-gram models*, where the probability of a sequence is estimated based on the frequency of sub-sequences.  
  - **Bayesian Inference:** Modern techniques extend these ideas by incorporating prior knowledge and modeling uncertainty.
  
- **Probabilistic Graphical Models:**  
  Methods like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and sequence labeling.  
  - These models provide a framework for reasoning about uncertainty and dependencies between words.

### Representation & Embeddings
- **Word Embeddings:**  
  Techniques like *Word2Vec*, *GloVe*, and more recently, *contextual embeddings* (e.g., BERT, ELMo) transform words into dense vector representations that capture semantic similarity.  
  - **Distributional Hypothesis:** ‚ÄúYou shall know a word by the company it keeps‚Äù underpins these methods.
  
- **Subword & Character-Level Representations:**  
  These approaches address out-of-vocabulary issues and capture morphological nuances by representing words at subword or character levels.

### Sequence Modeling & Attention
- **Recurrent Models:**  
  Early neural approaches employed RNNs and LSTMs/GRUs to model the sequential nature of text, capturing temporal dependencies.
  
- **Attention Mechanisms & Transformers:**  
  The advent of attention mechanisms revolutionized NLP by enabling models to focus on different parts of the input sequence.  
  - **Self-Attention & Transformers:** Modern architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT) leverage self-attention to learn contextual relationships efficiently, supporting large-scale parallel processing.

## How NLP Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and stop-word removal transform raw text into a structured format.
   
2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Convert text into numeric representations using embeddings or one-hot encodings.
   
3. **Modeling:**  
   Processed inputs are fed through neural architectures (e.g., RNNs, Transformers) to capture syntactic and semantic patterns.
   
4. **Prediction & Generation:**  
   Models perform tasks like classification, translation, or text generation, producing outputs that are decoded back into human-readable text.
   
5. **Evaluation:**  
   Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments are used to gauge model performance and guide iterative improvements.

## Architectures & Algorithms ü§ñ

### Classic Models
- **n-Gram & Statistical Models:**  
  Serve as baselines for language modeling and initial exploratory work.
- **HMMs & CRFs:**  
  Commonly used for sequence labeling tasks such as named entity recognition.

### Neural Models & Transformers
- **RNNs & LSTMs:**  
  Capture sequential dependencies; however, they may suffer from issues like vanishing gradients.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text:**  
  Efficiently capture local patterns and features within text.
- **Transformers:**  
  - **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Empowers models to dynamically weigh the importance of different words.
  - **Pretrained Language Models:** Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 are pretrained on vast corpora and fine-tuned for specialized tasks.
  
*Example Code Snippet:*  
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Initialize tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Tokenize input text
inputs = tokenizer("Deep NLP transforms raw text into rich embeddings.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs.logits)
