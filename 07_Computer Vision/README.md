## Theoretical Foundations üìñ

### Image Formation & Processing
- **Image Formation:**  
  Digital images capture the interaction of light with objects, converting continuous scenes into discrete pixel values.
  - **Sampling & Quantization:** Concepts that describe how continuous signals are represented in digital form.
  
- **Classical Image Processing:**  
  Techniques such as filtering, edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny), and morphological operations have long been used to extract information from images.
  - **Fourier Transform & Frequency Analysis:** Analyze the frequency components of images for tasks like denoising and compression.

### Feature Extraction & Representation
- **Handcrafted Features:**  
  Before deep learning, features like SIFT, SURF, and HOG were used to represent key aspects of images.
  - These methods focus on detecting edges, corners, and textures.
  
- **Learned Representations:**  
  With deep learning, features are automatically learned from data.
  - **Hierarchical Representations:** Lower layers capture edges and textures; higher layers capture complex patterns and objects.
  
### Deep Learning in Vision
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  
  CNNs use convolutional layers to extract spatial hierarchies of features.  
  - **Pooling & Normalization:** Techniques such as max-pooling and batch normalization improve invariance and training stability.
  
- **Modern Architectures:**  
  Models like ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception have pushed the state-of-the-art by addressing issues like vanishing gradients and computational efficiency.
  
- **Vision Transformers (ViT):**  
  Recently, transformer models have been adapted for vision tasks by treating images as sequences of patches.

## How Computer Vision Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Image Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  
   Capture or load images, then apply preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.
   
2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Use either classical methods (e.g., edge detection) or deep neural networks (e.g., CNNs) to extract meaningful features.
   
3. **Modeling & Inference:**  
   Process features using machine learning models to perform tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, or generation.
   
4. **Postprocessing:**  
   Refine the output through techniques such as non-maximum suppression (for detection) or morphological operations (for segmentation).
   
5. **Evaluation:**  
   Compare model predictions against ground truth using various quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

## Architectures & Algorithms ü§ñ

### Classical Approaches
- **Handcrafted Feature Methods:**  
  Algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, and HOG were widely used for object recognition and image matching.
  
- **Traditional Machine Learning:**  
  Techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests are used with handcrafted features for classification and detection tasks.

### Deep Neural Networks & CNNs
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  
  The backbone of modern computer vision, CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies from raw pixel data.
  - Popular models: AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, DenseNet.
  
- **Object Detection & Segmentation:**  
  Methods such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, YOLO, and Mask R-CNN enable detection and pixel-level segmentation of objects in images.
  
### Vision Transformers & Emerging Models
- **Vision Transformers (ViT):**  
  These models break images into patches and apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global context.
  - Often combined with convolutional layers in hybrid architectures for improved performance.

*Example Code Snippet (Using a Pretrained CNN with PyTorch):*  
```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load a pretrained ResNet model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Define image transforms
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

# Load and preprocess an image
img = Image.open("sample.jpg")
img_t = transform(img)
batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    out = model(batch_t)
print(out)
