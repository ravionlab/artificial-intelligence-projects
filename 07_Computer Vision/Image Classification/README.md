# Image Classification

## Overview & Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental computer vision task that assigns predefined labels or categories to an entire input image. It forms the backbone of many visual recognition systems and has transformed industries ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.

**Role in Computer Vision**:
Image classification serves as a cornerstone task in computer vision where algorithms learn to recognize patterns and features to categorize images into distinct classes. It represents one of the most successful applications of deep learning.

### Historical Context
While early approaches relied on handcrafted features and traditional machine learning, the field was revolutionized in 2012 when AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network by Krizhevsky et al., dramatically outperformed previous methods on the ImageNet challenge. This breakthrough initiated the deep learning era in computer vision.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Conceptual Explanation
Image classification algorithms learn to map input images to categorical labels through feature extraction and pattern recognition. Modern approaches typically use deep neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual data, starting from low-level features (edges, textures) to high-level semantic concepts.

### Mathematical Formulation
**Loss Function**: For multi-class classification, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used:
$$ L = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) $$
where:
- $$ C $$: Number of classes
- $$ y_i $$: Ground truth (one-hot encoded)
- $$ \hat{y}_i $$: Predicted probability for class $i$

**Softmax Activation**: The final layer typically uses softmax to convert logits to probabilities:
$$ \hat{y}_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{C} e^{z_j}} $$
where $$ z_i $$ is the logit for class $i$.

### Assumptions
1. Images within the same class share common visual patterns.
2. The training dataset adequately represents the distribution of test data.
3. Classes are mutually exclusive (for single-label classification).
4. Visual features are sufficient to distinguish between classes.

## Algorithm Mechanics

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Load, resize, normalize images, and convert labels to one-hot encoding.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract hierarchical representations through convolutional layers.
3. **Classification**: Process features through fully connected layers to produce class probabilities.
4. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the difference between predictions and ground truth.
5. **Backpropagation**: Update model weights to minimize the loss function.
6. **Inference**: Use the trained model to classify new images.

### Training & Prediction Workflow
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

# Create model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10, validation_data=val_dataset)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(test_images)
```
